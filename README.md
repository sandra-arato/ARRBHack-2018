# ARRBHack-2018
data hacking for the ARRB Hack - solving transport and infrastructure related problems

## About the repo
This repo uses public / open source datasets and [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) to process and visualise them.

If you haven't used Jupyter before, I recommend this easy getting started guide: [Jupyter Notebook Beginner Guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/).
